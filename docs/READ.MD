“Our project is a hybrid safety system that combines manual SOS with automatic risk detection. The system continuously monitors contextual data like time, location, and movement. If the user presses SOS, alerts are sent immediately. If the user cannot act, the system calculates a real-time risk score and automatically notifies trusted contacts and the police when the risk exceeds a critical threshold. This ensures safety even when the user is unable to respond.”
